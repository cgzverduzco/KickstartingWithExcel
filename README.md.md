### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
It's the first analysis of data for me, and IÂ´m don't know much about the entertainment sector. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Spring, Summer, and Fall are goods seasons for having success in the play.

The cold weather makes the market for entertainment down. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Have low expectations is better. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
We need to know the business for making the right conclusion. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Glad to know the data for country and type of player.
